# Project Plan: WebAssembly-based Remote Management Framework

This document outlines the development plan for the WebAssembly-based Remote Management Framework.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)

*   **Technology:** We'll use Rust for its performance, safety, and excellent WebAssembly support.
*   **Initial Components:**
    *   A basic **agent** that can run on a host machine.
    *   A "hello-world" **WASM module** to demonstrate sandboxed execution.
    *   A central **controller** server that the agent can connect to.
*   **Goal:** The controller will be able to instruct the agent to run the WASM module.

## Phase 2: Web Dashboard and API

*   **API:** We'll build a REST API for the controller to manage agents and tasks.
*   **Frontend:** We'll create a web-based dashboard using React, TypeScript, and Bootstrap for a modern and responsive UI. This will allow you to view connected agents and trigger tasks from your browser.

## Phase 3: Security and Advanced Features

*   **Security:** We'll implement TLS for encrypted communication, and add token-based authentication and access control.
*   **Dynamic Plugins:** We'll enhance the system to allow dynamically loading and running new WASM modules (plugins) on the agents.
*   **Persistence:** We'll add a database to the controller for storing agent information, task history, and audit logs.

## Phase 4: Cross-Platform and Deployment

*   **Cross-Platform Agents:** We'll set up the build process to compile the agent for various operating systems and architectures (Windows, macOS, Linux, ARM, etc.).
*   **Containerization:** We'll create Docker containers for easy deployment and scalability, with support for Kubernetes.
